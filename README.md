# Analyzing-Marketing-Channel-Effectiveness

:bar_chart: Business Problem
The main aim of the analysis is to understand the elements that actually make the ship sail with the marketing department in that way. In particular, the research aimed at separating such campaign types and marketing initiatives as ad spending, email, and visits to the website with the highest impact on customer conversion.
Key Insights
1. Conversion Rates Across Campaign Types
The whole campaign variety (including Promotion, Retention, Purchase, and Awareness) showed a relatively equal average conversion rate, which hovers in the range of 10-11%. This proves that there is no single campaign type that would be significantly better than others in terms of making the conversions of the people. However, this is also a potential explanation that we might be focusing and communicating on our targets that are identical across several campaigns, and thus, we have stable performance.
2. Correlation Analysis: What Drives Conversions?
The correlation matrix offered us an overview of which factors exert a significant influence on the level of customer acquisition. Therefore, the most outstanding ones are:
Ad Spend: A very weak revenue rate from ad spending lead us to the conclusion that simply giving more money does not result in a better conversion rate. That means we must get better at ad targeting and creating ad content than just spending more to win more customers.
Click-Through Rate (CTR): CTR also showed a weak level of correlation with the rate of conversion so this implies while advertisements may get clicks, they do not promise sales. It may also hint towards a disconnection between the ad and the landing pages of the website.
Website Engagement (Visits & Time on Site): Besides the fact that there were minimal visits to the site and time spent on the site was also low, it was observed that they did not contribute much to the conversion rate. This hint that while people are spending time on the site, not everyone is clicking through. Improving landing page experience, CTAs, and product offerings could help.
Email Engagement (Opens & Clicks): Opens and clicks did not show any substantial correlation with the conversion rate, which points to the fact that email marketing attempts might need to be re-examined. Are we targeting the right audience? Is the content striking enough to pull in the desired conversions?
